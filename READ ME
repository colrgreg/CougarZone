Testing Documentation
Essentially, we just used end to end user testing. 
With TDD, we came up with tests.  
For example,  for the register function, the test case was "new user registered and logged in Firestore"
We then implemented this function and made sure it worked.
Using end to end testing, we ran through the main functions of our system: register,  log in, purchase ticket, etc.

The recent "update" commits highlight sections of code that we were developing, testing, and making sure they functioned simultaneously.  
After we saw that they functioned, they were committed.
